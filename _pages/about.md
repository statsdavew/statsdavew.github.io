## Introduction

My research interests are in the statistical design and analysis of experiments, particularly the development of new methods and criteria for design selection and assessment under linear and nonlinear models. A particular emphasis of my work is finding efficient designs when there is uncertainty in one or more aspects of the model for the response. I develop methodology that combines theory and computation to solve problems motivated by real experiments in science and industry. Application areas include engineering, chemistry and the pharmaceutical, automotive and aeronautics industries.

In 2019, I was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. From 2012-2017, I held a 5-year [EPSRC Fellowship](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/J018317/1) to conduct research into design of experiments for the complex nonparametric and mechanistic models required for modern scientific and industrial problems. 
From 2019-2023, I was a [Turing Fellow](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/david-woods).
<!-- and an organiser of the Turing Institute's [Uncertainty Quantification Interest Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/uncertainty-quantification).-->

I have been an investigator on research grants and contracts from a range of funding bodies and have extensive research links with industry and government, including [GlaxoSmithKline](https://www.gsk.com) and [Dstl](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory). I am an Associate Editor for the [Journal of the American Statistical Association](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uasa20), [Technometrics](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/loi/utch20) and the [SIAM/ASA Journal of Uncertainty Quantification](https://www.siam.org/Publications/Journals/SIAM-ASA-Journal-on-Uncertainty-Quantification-JUQ), and a member of the [EPSRC Peer Review College](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/assessmentprocess/college/) and previously (2020-22) the [NSERC Mathematics and Statistics Evaluation Group](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/committees-comites/MathematicStatistics-MathematiqueStatistique_eng.asp).
