## Teaching

In 2022/23, I am teaching

Course materials for enrolled students can be found on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.soton.ac.uk).

I am also a member of the Executive Committee of the Academy for [PhD Training in Statistics (APTS)](http://www.apts.ac.uk/). In between 2012 and 2022, I taught the Statistical Modelling and Design of Experiments modules. Course materials for the Design of Experiments course can be found [here](https://statsdavew.github.io/apts.doe/).
